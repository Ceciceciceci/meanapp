This website is built with MEAN stack.
Mongodb, Expressjs, Angularjs, and Nodejs.

This application includes a page where you can add as many videos
in a list and view them and the pages after are some random for 
fun pure css and javascript tests where you can interact with them.
There is audio running in the background on one of them.

You can run this application by going to this Heroku link:
https://floating-fjord-65382.herokuapp.com/#/movies
Github link:
https://github.com/Ceciceciceci/meanapp

If you want to run this app locally, make sure to have mongodb running
and run it using node.

All CSS and Javascript is pure. 
Yeoman was used to make most of the template files, so that it was easier
to add controllers and html pages.
